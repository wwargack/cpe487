# cpe487 - Digital System Design

## Directories

- Assignment 1 ([hw1](./hw1))
  - Find a VHDL model not included in the textbook.
  - Add a comment citing the source and upload the file to your GitHub Repository.
[//]: #- sqrt8.vhdl [source](https://www.csee.umbc.edu/portal/help/VHDL/samples/sqrt8.html)  
  
- Assignment 2 ([hw2](./hw2))
  - Develop a test bench for your VHDL file from assignment 1.
  - Run GHDL to generate a vcd file.
  - Use GTKWave to view the VCD file and take a screenshot.
  - Upload the design, test bench, and VCD files to your GitHub repository.
  - Create a readme.md file to include the screenshot.

- Lab 1 ([leddec](./lab1/leddec), [hexcount](./lab1/hexcount))
